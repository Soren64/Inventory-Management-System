# Inventory-Management-System
Simple C# console app leveraging .NET modules to operate a MVC architecture.

The application takes inspiration from software that I've used for work. 

The application manages a local database (SQLite). The database is created and managed for you all through .NET (No SQL/queries required!).

# How to Run
Requires .NET SDK (version 5.0 used in this application). Clone the repo, then in the project directory run "dotnet build" (for bin/obj files- NOT included) then "dotnet run" from the command line.

# License
None.
